Merry Brickfall – README 

A learning project for understanding how 2D games work in JavaScript using HTML Canvas.

What is this project?
Merry Brickfall is a simple web game inspired by Breakout.
The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bounces a ball to break bricks.

This project is intentionally written to be very readable and heavily commented, so beginners (or me in the future) can easily undertand:
* How a game loop works
* How movement, collisions, drawing, and input work
* How to structure a small game cleanly
* Why certain variables or math is used

The best part is you can use this project as:
* A reference for future games
* A foundation to build more feature
* A learn exercise for JavaScript and Canvas
* A blueprint for world dominiation
